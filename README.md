Date: 

Initial Version: 4/19/2022

Updated Version(to GitHub): 4/26/2022

How Long It Takes: It takes me more than 15 hours to accomplish

What I Added:
- Redesign the game's artwork 
I changed the background and the theme of this game
In this new version, it becomes sunshine v.s. clouds

- Display the time remaining (in seconds) on the screen 

- Create a new spaceship type (w/ new artwork) that's smaller, moves faster, and is worth more points 
A new cloud in this version
Receiving 30 points if it is hit

- Implement an alternating two-player mode. In this mode, there is one rocket, and players take turns controlling this one rocket

Player1: Use Key A&D to move & SPACE to fire

Player2: Use ←→ arrows to move & F to fire
